# 数字隐私与安全- 为什么重要


**简而言之;** 隐私是一项基本权利，对于民主，自由和言论自由至关重要。政府（通过大规模监视），公司（通过出售个人数据获利）和网络犯罪分子（窃取我们安全性较差的个人数据并将其用于我们）正在滥用我们的隐私。为了使您的私人数据保持私密性，需要安全性，而良好的数字安全性对于保护免受数据战带来的日益增长的风险至关重要。

## 什么是个人数据？
个人数据是与已识别或可识别的生活个体有关的任何信息。即使是已被取消识别或匿名处理的数据，也经常可以用来重新识别一个人，尤其是与辅助数据集结合使用时。

这可能是敏感文件（例如病历，银行对帐单，卡号等）或用户生成的内容（消息，电子邮件，照片，搜索记录，家庭监控等）或明显的元数据（例如鼠标单击， 键入模式，在每个网页上花费的时间等）

## 数据是如何收集的？
网络跟踪是最常见的数据收集方法之一。在你上网的时候，网站使用Cookie，设备指纹和其他方法识别并跟踪你。通常用于广告，分析和个性化。当这些数据汇总在一起后，可以非常详细地对你进行用户画像。

## 数据是如何存储的？
通常，已收集的数据存储在服务器上的数据库中。这些服务器很少归管理它们的公司所有，[56% 的服务器](https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-market-Q3-2019) 由Amazon AWS，Google Cloud和Microsoft Azure拥有。如果存储正确，数据将被加密，并且需要进行身份验证才能访问。但是通常情况并非如此，[几乎每天都在发生](https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-in-2019/)大量的数据泄露。当黑客黑掉了存储个人数据的数据库时，随之而来的便是数据泄露。实际上，您的数据可能已经泄漏了(在 [我的密码已经泄露了吗](https://haveibeenpwned.com) 检查一下你的邮箱地址看看)

## 个人数据会被用来干什么？

数据由政府，执法机构，公司（有时甚至是犯罪分子）收集，存储和使用：

### 政府大规模监视
情报和执法机构需要监视权来处理严重犯罪和恐怖主义。但是，自从斯诺登（Snowden）曝光后，我们现在知道，这种监视并不针对那些嫌疑犯，而是针对所有人。我们所有的数字互动都被我们自己的政府进行记录和跟踪。

大规模监视是一种控制和压制手段，它剥夺了我们的固有自由并滋生了顺从。当我们知道自己正在被监视时，我们会下意识地改变行为。充满监视的社会离独裁社会仅一步之遥。

### 公司
在互联网上，数据的价值很高。所有公司都想确切地知道您是谁以及您在做什么。他们收集，存储，使用数据，有时甚至将其出售。

我们每个人在网上所做的一切都会留下数据痕迹。这些痕迹构成了信息的金矿，在个人层面上可以更好的了解一个人，同时也能更大的反应文化，经济和政治趋势。科技巨头（例如Google，Facebook，Apple，Amazon和Microsoft）正在利用这一优势，从与数字设备互动产生的数据中构建数十亿美元的业务。作为用户，我们无法保证所收集的内容可以安全地存储，我们经常无法确定是否按我们的要求将其删除，并且我们无从得知其AI系统如何使用我们的数据。

我们的计算机，电话，可穿戴设备，数字助理和物联网设备已经变成了公司拥有的庞大监控网络的一部分。我们去哪里，做什么，谈论什么，与谁谈话，和看见谁–一切都被记录下来，并在某个时刻被利用来实现价值。他们非常了解我们，甚至了解我们对最亲近的人所隐藏的东西。在我们现代的互联网生态系统中，这种私人监视已成为常态。

### Cybercriminals
Hackers and cybercriminals pose an ongoing and constantly evolving threat. With the ever-increasing amount of our personal data being collected and logged - we are more vulnerable to data breaches and identity fraud than ever before.

In the same way, criminals will go to great lengths to use your data against you: either through holding it ransom, impersonating you, stealing money or just building up a profile on you and selling it on, to another criminal entity.

## Why Data Privacy Matters

#### Data Privacy and Freedom of Speech
Privacy is a fundamental right, and you shouldn't need to prove the necessity of fundamental right to anyone. As Edward Snowden said, "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say". There are many scenarios in which privacy is crucial and desirable like intimate conversations, medical procedures, and voting. When we know we are being watched, our behavior changes, which in turn suppresses things like free speech.

#### Data Can Have Control Over You
Knowledge is power; Knowledge about you is power over you. Your information will be used to anticipate your actions and manipulate the way you shop, vote, and think. When you know you are being watched, you subconsciously change your behavior. Mass surveillance  is an effective, means of fostering compliance with social norms or with social orthodoxy. Without privacy, you might be afraid of being judged by others, even if you're not doing anything wrong. It can be a heavy burden constantly having to wonder how everything we do will be perceived by others.

#### Data Can Be Used Against You
Your personal information and private communications can be "cherry-picked" to paint a certain one-sided picture. It can make you look like a bad person, or criminal, even if you are not. Data often results in people not being judged fairly- standards differ between cultures, organisations, and generations. Since data records are permanent, behavior that is deemed acceptable today, may be held against you tomorrow. Further to this, even things we don't think are worth hiding today, may later be used against us in unexpected ways.

#### Data Collection Has No Respect For Boundaries
Data collection has no respect for social boundaries, you may wish to prevent some people (such as employers, family or former partners) from knowing certain things about you. Once you share personal data, even with a party you trust, it is then out of your control forever, and at risk of being hacked, leaked or sold. An attack on our privacy, also hurts the privacy of those we communicate with.

#### Data Discriminates
When different pieces of your data is aggregated together, it can create a very complete picture of who you are. This data profile, is being used to influence decisions made about you: from insurance premiums, job prospects, bank loan eligibility and license decisions. It can determine whether we are investigated by the government, searched at the airport, or blocked from certain services. Even what content you see on the internet is affected by our personal data. This typically has a bigger impact on minority groups, who are unfairly judged the most. Without having the ability to know or control what, how, why and when our data is being used, we loose a level of control. One of the hallmarks of freedom is having autonomy and control over our lives, and we can’t have that if so many important decisions about us are being made in the dark, without our awareness or participation.

#### The "I Have Nothing to Hide" Argument
Privacy isn’t about hiding information; privacy is about protecting information, and everyone has information that they’d like to protect. Even with nothing to hide, you still put blinds on your window, locks on your door, and passwords on your email account.- Nobody would want their search history, bank statements, photos, notes or messages to be publicly available to the world.

#### Data Privacy needs to be for Everyone
For online privacy to be effective, it needs to be adopted my the masses, and not just the few. By exercising your right to privacy, you make it easier for others, such as activists and journalists, to do so without sticking out.

## So What Should we Do?

- Educate yourself about what's going on and why it matters
- Be aware of changes to policies, revelations, recent data breaches and related news
- Take steps to secure your online accounts and protect your devices
- Understand how to communicate privately, and how use the internet anonymously
- Use software and services that respect your privacy, and keep your data safe
- Support organisations that fight for your privacy and internet freedom
- Find a way to make your voice heard, and stand up for what you believe in
